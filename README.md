## Flashcard Amigo

A simple flashcard app for helping with Spanish vocabulary.  The idea is to 
write the backend as an AWS Amplify application as a learning exercise and
then to be able to have front ends written in Flutter, React, or whatever
I want to learn next.

The directories in this project indicate which front ends have been created,
starting with Flutter.
