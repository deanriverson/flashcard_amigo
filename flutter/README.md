# Flashcard Amigo

A flash card app where you swipe right when you are correct and left when you're wrong and need more practice.

It counts how many tries it takes you to get through each set of 10 words. These sets
are saved along with the words so you can see how you're doing as time progresses and
you can revisit sets that gave you trouble.
